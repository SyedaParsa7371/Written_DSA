There are many ways to solve one problem and they haave different time complexity
When we talk about performance, we can use absolute measure
absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted it depend on many factors
-Programming language used to implement the algorithm
-The speed of computers in which program run
-Other programs run on same time

The performance of an algori is base on the input size and the two factors 
Time Complexity:amount of time take by an algoritm to run,as a function of input size.
Space Complexity:amount of memory take by an algoritm to run,as a function of input size.

the input size and the time complexity depeneds on the algorthm analaysis.

There was no one solution thst works every time you should always know multiple ways to solve the single problem and use the best solution 
---How to represent time complexity
Asymptotic notations is used to measure time and space complexity
There are three ways of notations:
1.Big-O notation __Worst Case Complexity
2.Omega Notation__Best Case Complexity
3.Theta Notation__Average Case Complexity
