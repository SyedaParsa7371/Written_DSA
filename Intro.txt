algorithm is a set of well defined structure to solve any problem

			Algorithm of adding two numbers
Two numbers a and b------->1.Add numbers usig "+"-------->sum of "a" and "b"
			   2.Return the Value
Characterstics:
Well defined inputs and Output
Each step should be clear
language independent

One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms
Every algorithm comes with its own performane
